## D3.a: Core Mechanics

Key technical challenge: assembling a map-based UI using Leaflet.

### Steps

- [x] copy main.ts to reference.ts
- [x] delete everything in main.ts
- [x] display a basic Leaflet map centered at classroom location
- [x] draw a player marker
- [x] render a grid of cells on the map
- [x] show which cells contain tokens
- [x] implement cell math + draw one cell
- [x] render a full grid covering the viewport
- [x] deterministic token spawn function
- [x] enforce nearby-only interaction
- [x] single-slot inventory & pickup
- [ ] merge equal→double + win check
- [ ] (D3.a complete) commit
